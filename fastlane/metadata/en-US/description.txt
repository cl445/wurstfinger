Wurstfinger - The Keyboard for Fat Fingers

Tired of typos? Wurstfinger is a privacy-conscious keyboard with large keys and swipe gestures. Based on the proven MessagEase layout, it replaces the cramped QWERTY grid with a 3x3 layout optimized for thumb typing.

Unlike mainstream keyboards, Wurstfinger doesn't rely on invasive word prediction - instead, it achieves accuracy through ergonomic design. Large, well-spaced keys mean fewer missed taps, and the gesture system lets you access all characters without hunting for tiny buttons.

FEATURES:

• Large 3x3 Key Grid - Optimized for thumbs, not precision pointers
• Swipe Gestures - Access 8 additional characters per key by swiping
• 14 Languages - German, English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Polish, Czech, and Vietnamese
• Compose Rules - Create accents through combinations (e.g. ' + a = á)
• Circular Gestures - Draw a circle for uppercase letters
• Cursor Control - Drag on space bar to move cursor, long-press for text selection
• Haptic Feedback - Customizable vibration intensity
• Fully Adjustable - Scale keyboard size to your preference

PRIVACY FIRST:

• No data collection
• No network access
• No word prediction tracking
• All processing happens locally on your device

Wurstfinger requires training - expect a few days to build muscle memory. But once you've crossed that threshold, you'll never want to go back to a standard keyboard. The gestures become second nature, and you'll type faster and with fewer errors than ever before.

Your fingers will thank you!
