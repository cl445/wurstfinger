# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 2025**

## Overview

Wurstfinger is a keyboard app that respects your privacy. We believe your typing should stay private.

## Data Collection

**Wurstfinger does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Specifically:
- We do not collect what you type
- We do not collect usage statistics
- We do not use analytics services
- We do not track your location
- We do not access your contacts
- We do not share any data with third parties

## Full Access Permission

iOS may ask you to grant "Full Access" to the keyboard. This permission is **optional** and only used for:
- Haptic feedback (vibration when you tap keys)

Even with Full Access enabled, Wurstfinger does not transmit any data. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Network Access

Wurstfinger does not require network access and does not connect to the internet.

## Data Storage

Your keyboard preferences (such as haptic feedback intensity and keyboard scale) are stored locally on your device using iOS's standard settings storage. This data never leaves your device.

## Children's Privacy

Wurstfinger does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
