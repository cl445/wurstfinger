# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** November 2025

## Overview

Wurstfinger is a keyboard app that respects your privacy. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No keystrokes are recorded or transmitted
- No personal information is collected
- No analytics or tracking is used

## Local Storage

Wurstfinger stores your preferences (such as keyboard size, haptic feedback settings, and language selection) locally on your device using iOS UserDefaults. This data:

- Never leaves your device
